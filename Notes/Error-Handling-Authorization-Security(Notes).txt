1. Whatever passed inside the next() is an error and if and error occurs, then express will skip all middleware functions
and go directly to the global error handling function.

2. JWT is used to authorize users. It follows the principals that an API should be stateless.

During signup user enters his credentials and the server checks if they exist inside the DB. The server then sends a JWT
token to the client which is saved in localStorage or cookie. Now when the user wants to access some protected route, a JWT
token must be sent which is then verified on the server.

The signing algorithm starts first:
    First the Header + Payload and the secret key is used to generate a signature. Together with Header and Signature, JWT
    token is formed which then gets sent to the server. The test signature is then generated at the server using the secret
    key and if the signature and test signature match, then the data has not been tempered with and the authentication is
    successfull.
