Node.js is a javascript runtime built on top of Chrome's V8 engine.
    What this actually means is that javascript is usually localised to the browser. Node brings javascript out of
    the browser and executes it inside a different runtime which is node.js itself. This allows us to create servers
    using javascript. V8 engine actually executes the javascript.

Node should not be used for applications involving CPU intensive tasks on the server side. 
Node.js can be used for building real time, WEB API's etc.

Asynchronous Nature of Node.js
    Synchronous code is blocking code because it blocks the execution of everything else in the program.
    Similarly Asynchronous code is non blocking and calls a callback function when the process is completed.

There are two kinds of dependencies that can be installed using npm:

1. Regular Dependencies : These are the dependencies that are used for creating the project. Used inside code. (eg. slugify)
2. Development Dependencies : These are the dependencies that make things easier while coding but not used in production. (eg. nodemon)


Package Versioning:
    x.y.z
    x => Major changes to the package. Can have breaking changes.
    y => Minor changes, new functionality but no breaking changes.
    z => Bug Fixes.
    
    Can be prefixed with ^, ~ or *
    ^ means minor changes (Most Used)
    ~ means only bug fixes (Safest)
    * means all changed
