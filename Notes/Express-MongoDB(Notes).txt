Express is an abstracted wrapper around node.js. It provides functionality to setup server code and routes with a lot less
pain in the ass.

What is a API:

An API(Application programming interface) is a piece of software that can be used by another piece of software in order to
allow applications to talk to each other.

In context of web development the API's that we build are called Web API's but the term Application can have a broader
meaning.

1. Node.js fs or http API (Node API's)
2. Browser's DOM Javascript API.
3. With OOP, when exposing methods to the public, we're creating an API.

The REST architecture:

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architecture for developing web API's and they should follow 5 important rules.

1. Separate API's into logical resources (eg: /tours, /users)
2. Expose structured, resource-based URLs
3. Use HTTP methods (verbs) GET /tours instead of getTours
4. Send data as JSON (usually). JSON can be further enveloped into some more JSON like this {status : "success", data : {DATA HERE}}
5. Be stateless. State management should be done on the client side and not on the server. Server should not have to remember
    any state.

Status Codes for http methods:

1. 200 : Ok (For get request and patch request)
2. 201 : Created (For post request)
3. 204 : No content (For delete request)

The callback function inside a http method is called a route handler.
